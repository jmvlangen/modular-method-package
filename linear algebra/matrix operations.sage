def smallest_entry_in_column(M, j, N=0, i0=0, give_gcd=False):
    r"""
    Finds the row with the smallest entry in a given column.

    This method works on integer matrices or matrices defined
    over the integers modulo some number. The smallest value
    is determined by the gcd of the number and the modulus.
    Note that for modulus 0 this corresponds to working over
    $\Z$ and using the standard absolute value.

    INPUT:

    - ``M`` -- A matrix with integer entries or entries in
               the ring of integers modulo a given N
    - ``j`` -- The column in which one wants to find the
               smallest element. Must be an integer between
               0 and M.dimensions()[1]
    - ``N`` -- A non-negative integer (default=0) giving the
               modulus with which to work.
    - ``i0`` -- A non-negative integer (default=0) indicating
                the least row to be checked. All rows before
                the i0-th row will be ignored. Setting this value
                to at least M.dimensions()[0] will return 0 by
                default.
    - ``give_gcd`` -- A boolean (default=False) indicating
                      whether the corresponding gcd should also
                      be returned.

    OUTPUT:
    
    Returns the index of the row of M of which the j-th entry has
    the smallest possible gcd with N possible. Note that gcd 0 will
    be considered to be the largest possible gcd. If no entry was
    found, e.g. if i0 >= M.dimensions()[0], then i0 will be returned
    as the index. If the flag give_gcd is set to True, the returned
    value will be a tuple containing the index as the first entry
    and the corresponding gcd as its second value. Note that this
    gcd will be 0 if i0 >= M.dimensions()[0].

    EXAMPLES:
    
    For modulus 0 finds the smallest value ::

        sage: M = matrix([[1,2,0],[0,3,0]]); M
        [1 2 0]
        [0 3 0]
        sage: smallest_entry_in_column(M, 1)
        0

    whilst for modulus 4 it finds the smallest gcd ::
    
        sage: M = matrix([[1,2,0],[0,3,0]]); M
        [1 2 0]
        [0 3 0]
        sage: smallest_entry_in_column(M, 2, N=4, give_gcd=True)
        (1, 1)
    
    Note that it considers 0 as the biggest value ::
    
        sage: M = matrix([[1,2,0],[0,3,0]]); M
        [1 2 0]
        [0 3 0]
        sage: smallest_entry_in_column(M, 0, give_gcd=True)
        (0, 1)

    Forcing it to look only below a certain row we can force
    if to choose 0 as the smallest ::
    
        sage: M = matrix([[1,2,0],[0,3,0]]); M
        [1 2 0]
        [0 3 0]
        sage: smallest_entry_in_column(M, 0, i0=1, give_gcd=True)
        (1, 0)

    Choosing a too big i0 will always result in i0 and 0 ::

        sage: M = matrix([[1,2,0],[0,3,0]]); M
        [1 2 0]
        [0 3 0]
        sage: smallest_entry_in_column(M, 2, i0=5, give_gcd=True)
        (5, 0)
