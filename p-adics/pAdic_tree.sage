class pAdicNode(SageObject):
    r"""
    A node of a p-adic tree.
    
    A p-adic node consist of the following data, which
    together constitute a node in a unique p-adic tree:
    - A pAdicBase object that determines the p-adics.
    - A tuple of representatives of the residue field of these p-adics,
      called the coefficients of this node.
    - A reference to the parent of this node if it has one.
    - A pAdicNodeCollection of children of this node.
    
    A p-adic tree consists of p-adic nodes that are linked
    together via parent - child connections. A p-adic tree
    satisfies the following properties:
    - If a node is a child of another node, than that second
      node has the first as its parent.
    - There is a unique node without a parent, called the root.
    - Each node has at most one child with a specific tuple of
      representatives.
    
    Note that each node can recursively find the root of
    the tree through its parents. Furthermore, each node has
    a level, i.e. the number of parents above that node,
    which can again be retrieved recursively.
    
    Using the coefficients p-adic nodes also have an interpretation
    as tuples of numbers. For this let `R`, `P` and `\pi` be respectively
    the maximal order, the prime ideal and a uniformizer of the
    p-adics for this node, then we can represent the node as
    ..MATH::
        
        r + c * \pi^(l-1)
        
    where `r` is a representative of its parent (or zero if it has
    none), `c` is the coefficients of this node, and `l` is the
    level of this node.
    
    Note that all p-adic nodes of a specific level `n` give
    unique representatives of a free module over `R / (P^n)`.
    Also appending such representations up to infinity, will
    result in unique representations of p-adic integers.

          be the root of a p-adic tree.
        - ``children`` -- A pAdicNodeCollection or None
          (default: None). If it is a pAdicNodeCollection it
          should be the collection of children of this node. If
          it is None it will be initialized as an empty or full
          connection depending on the argument ``full``

          which case it can be None. If the ``parent`` argument is given
          the p-adics will be set to that of the parent node.
        - ``coefficients`` -- A tuple of numbers or None
          (default: None). This is the coefficients of this node.
          Note that for working correctly the tuple must consist
          of representatives of the residue field of the p-adics
          of this node, as returned by this node's pAdicBase object,
          however there is no check to ensure that this is the case.

          on a level below it or no children at all, respectively
          True and False. If the argument ``children`` is specified
          this argument will be ignored.

          node should contain. Note that this argument will be
          ignored if either the ``coefficients`` or the ``parent``
          argument is given. If the ``parent`` argument is given,
          it will revert to the width of the parent. If the

    - A finite collection of ordered variables.
