        that for the Qcurve class the parameter guessed degrees
        is always set to zero as there is no good way to guess

          over a polynomial ring over the minimal galois
          extension of its base field and will become the

          is defined. This is the ring in which the variables
          of the polynomial ring over which this curve is
          defined can take values.

          solution ring to the base ring of the polynomial
          ring over which the coefficients of this curve
          are defined. If set to None, will attempt to find

          are possible instead.

           data of the corresponding isogeny from the galois conjugate of this

           respectively the $\lambda$ such that the isogeny is

          primes_of_possible_additive_reduction and by computing
          the ramified primes of the decomposition field.

          None) giving the condition that the parameters of
          this Frey curve should satisfy. If set to None will
          use the condition stored in this FreyCurve instead.
        - ``verbose`` -- A boolean value or an integer
          (default: False). When set to True or any value
          larger then zero will print comments to stdout
          about the computations being done whilst busy. If
          set to False or 0 will not print such comments.
          If set to any negative value will also prevent
          the printing of any warnings.
          If this method calls any method that accepts an
          argument verbose will pass this argument to it.
          If such a method fulfills a minor task within
          this method and the argument verbose was larger
          than 0, will instead pass 1 less than the given
          argument. This makes it so a higher value will
          print more details about the computation than a
          lower one.
        - ``precision_cap`` A strictly positive integer
          (default: 20) giving the maximal precision level to be
          used in p-Adic arithmetic.

        Gives the possible levels of newforms associated to this Frey Q-curve.

        NOTE:

        These newforms are computed using only finitely many information which can
        be supplied by the user through the parameter N. Otherwise the information
        will be limited to the left side of the expression returned by
        conductor_restriction_of scalars.

        For Frey curves this is sufficient information, since level lowering results
        often imply that a newform of the level mentioned above should exist. Note
        that this is however not checked nor proved by this code, hence the user
        should verify this themself and supply a different N if necessary.

        INPUT:
        
        - ``prime`` -- A prime number or None (default: None) indicating the exponent
          of which prime the level should be computed or None for the level itself.
        - ``alpha`` -- A tuple of non-negative integers (default: None) containing the
          conductors of the characters associated to the newforms. Will be computed
          from the splitting characters up to conjugacy if set to None.
        - ``beta`` -- A tuple of tuples of non-negative integers (default: None)
          containing at index i, j the conductor of the twist that turns the i-th
          newform into the j-th newform. Will be computed from the twist characters
          up to conjugacy if set to None.
        - ``gamma`` -- A tuple of tuples of non-negative integers (default: None)
          containing at index i, j the conductor of the product of the twist that
          turns the i-th newform into the j-th newform and the character of the
          i-th newform. Will be computed from the twist characters and splitting
          characters up to conjugacy if set to None
        - ``d`` -- A tuple of non-negative integers (default: None) containing the
          respective degrees of the fields in which the newforms have their
          coefficients.
        - ``N`` -- A non-negative integer (default: None) or ConditionalValue with
          such values giving the conductor of the restriction of scalars of this
          Q-curve over the decomposition field. Will be computed using the
          corresponding method if set to None, in which case only the non-radical
          part of the resulting ConditionalExpression will be used.
        - ``condition`` -- A Condition giving the restrictions on the
          parameters on this Frey curve that should be considered. By default
          this will be set to the condition associated to this FreyCurve.
        
        OUTPUT:

        A list of tuples, each tuple representing one of the options for the levels
        of the newforms associated to this Q-curve. The n-th entry of such a tuple
        will correspond to the factor of the decomposition of scalars associated
        to the n-th splitting map obtained from splitting_map('conjugacy').
        If a prime was given, these tuples will contain the respective exponent
        of the given prime for each newform. If no prime was given, they will
        contain the respective level of each newform.

        If the argument N was a ConditionalValue will return a list of tuples
        each of which contain a list as described above as their first entry
        and a condition for which this list is relevant as their second entry.

        Computes the newforms that could be associated to this Frey Q-curve.

        To compute these newforms this method will perform the following procedure.
          - First of all this method will call the method _newform_levels to
            determine all the possible levels of the newforms associated
            to the abelian varieties of GL_2-type in which the restriction
            of scalars of this curve decomposes.
          - For each of these sets of levels associated to the decomposition,
            will compute the newforms at the lowest level among these levels,
            considering the appropiate character of the associated variety
            of GL_2-type. It will only consider those newforms that have a
            coefficient field that extends the endomorphism field of the
            appropiate abelian variety of GL_2-type.
          - Let K be the decomposition field of this curve and n be its degree.
            For each prime number p not divisible by any of the primes in
            additive primes and smaller than the given prime_cap, will compute
            a list of possible traces of the mod-l galois representation of
            this curve at the frobenius element
            of a prime above p to the power the ramification index of p. Next,
            for each remaining newform, it will compute the product of the
            difference of each ot these traces with the trace of the galois
            representation associated to the newform at the frobenius element
            at p to the power n. All l that divide this final product or p
            are considered the only candidates at which these galois
            representations can agree. If no such candidates remain the
            newform is eliminated.

        INPUT:
        - ``condition`` -- A Condition giving the restrictions on the
          parameters on this Frey curve that should be considered. By default
          this will be set to the condition associated to this FreyCurve.
        - ``additive_primes`` -- An iterable containing prime ideals
          or prime numbers, if the field of definition is QQ, that
          contains all the primes at which this curve can have
          additive reduction. If set to None will compute this
          by using the method primes_of_possible_additive_reduction
        - ``algorithm`` -- One of the following values
          'sage' -- to use sage to compute newforms (default)
          'magma' -- to use magma to compute newforms
        - ``prime_cap`` -- A strictly positive integer (default: 50)
          that gives a cap on the size of primes for which the
          traces of frobenius of this curve and a newform should
          be compared.
        - ``verbose`` -- A boolean value or an integer
          (default: False). When set to True or any value
          larger then zero will print comments to stdout
          about the computations being done whilst busy. If
          set to False or 0 will not print such comments.
          If set to any negative value will also prevent
          the printing of any warnings.
          If this method calls any method that accepts an
          argument verbose will pass this argument to it.
          If such a method fulfills a minor task within
          this method and the argument verbose was larger
          than 0, will instead pass 1 less than the given
          argument. This makes it so a higher value will
          print more details about the computation than a
          lower one.
        - ``precision_cap_conductor`` -- A strictly positive integer
          (default: 20) giving the maximal precision level to be
          used in p-Adic arithmetic when computing the conductor.
        - ``precision_cap_reduction`` -- A strictly positive
          integer (default: 1) giving the maximal precision level
          to be used in the p-Adic arithmetic when computing the
          reduction type at a given prime. Since this will do a
          computation for every prime lower than prime_cap, this
          might get very computational intensive if set to a value
          larger than 1.

        all primes, not dividing l, that are not in additive_primes
        up to the given prime_cap. The second entry is a list of all
        prime numbers l for which this is true.
