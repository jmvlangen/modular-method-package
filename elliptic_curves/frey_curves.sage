        of an expression ignoring those primes in additive_primes.

    def _newform_levels(self, N=None, **kwds):
        r"""
        Gives the possible levels of newforms associated to this Frey Q-curve.

        NOTE:

        These newforms are computed using only finitely many information which can
        be supplied by the user through the parameter N. Otherwise the information
        will be limited to the left side of the expression returned by
        conductor_restriction_of scalars.

        For Frey curves this is sufficient information, since level lowering results
        often imply that a newform of the level mentioned above should exist. Note
        that this is however not checked nor proved by this code, hence the user
        should verify this themself and supply a different N if necessary.

        INPUT:
        
        - ``prime`` -- A prime number or None (default: None) indicating the exponent
          of which prime the level should be computed or None for the level itself.
        - ``alpha`` -- A tuple of non-negative integers (default: None) containing the
          conductors of the characters associated to the newforms. Will be computed
          from the splitting characters up to conjugacy if set to None.
        - ``beta`` -- A tuple of tuples of non-negative integers (default: None)
          containing at index i, j the conductor of the twist that turns the i-th
          newform into the j-th newform. Will be computed from the twist characters
          up to conjugacy if set to None.
        - ``gamma`` -- A tuple of tuples of non-negative integers (default: None)
          containing at index i, j the conductor of the product of the twist that
          turns the i-th newform into the j-th newform and the character of the
          i-th newform. Will be computed from the twist characters and splitting
          characters up to conjugacy if set to None
        - ``d`` -- A tuple of non-negative integers (default: None) containing the
          respective degrees of the fields in which the newforms have their
          coefficients.
        - ``N`` -- A non-negative integer (default: None) or ConditionalValue with
          such values giving the conductor of the restriction of scalars of this
          Q-curve over the decomposition field. Will be computed using the
          corresponding method if set to None, in which case only the non-radical
          part of the resulting ConditionalExpression will be used.
        
        OUTPUT:

        A list of tuples, each tuple representing one of the options for the levels
        of the newforms associated to this Q-curve. If a prime was given, these
        tuples will contain the respective exponent of the given prime for each
        newform. If no prime was given, they will contain the respective level of
        each newform.

        If the argument N was a ConditionalValue will return a list of tuples
        each of which contain a list as described above as their first entry
        and a condition for which this list is relevant as their second entry.
