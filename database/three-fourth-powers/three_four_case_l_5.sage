### Phase 1: Limiting units

# Over this field we have f = 3*(a + v*b)*(a - v*b)*(a^2 + (v^2 + 4)*b^2)
h = a + v*b
# Outside primes above 2, 3 and 5, h and its galois conjugates
# in the field over which f splits are coprime.
# Using the knowledge that c is not divisible by 2, 3 and 5
# and the fact that v has valuation -1 at the prime above 3 only
# we see that the valuation of (a + v*b) must be
#  0 at primes above 2 and 5
#  -1 at the prime above 3
# Since P3^4 = 3, where P3 is the prime above 3, we find that
#   h = 3 * u * ch^5 (*)
# for u a unit and ch in K
# 
# Since the valuation of h at a prime is only negative at the prime above 3,
# the valuation of ch is non-negative at all primes except the prime above 3,
# Furthermore at the prime above 3 the valuation of ch is precisely -1
# This implies that 3*ch is in the ring of integers, hence
R4.<s1, s2, s3, s4> = QQ[]

UL = L.unit_group()
# Note that UL has two generators of which UL.0 has order 2 and is thus an 5-th power
# Therefore we only have to consider as units UL.1^i for i = 0, ..., 5
# This gives us the cases for the RHS in (*)

### Phase 2: Exluding the remaining cases through hyperelliptic curves
# L has a natural automorphism sending v to -v
s = L.hom([-v], L)
# Now g = h * s(h) has coefficients in the field K = Q(-v^2)
# which is a quadratic field that also contains the other factor of f
K.<w>, KtoL = L.subfield(-v^2)
g = a + w*b
# From (*) it follows that g satisfies
#   g = 9 * u' * cg^5 (**)
# where cg = ch * s(ch) is an element of K
# and u' = u * s(u) is a unit in K
# Note that f = g * t(g), where t is the non-trivial automorphism on K
# Again we know that cg is integral except possible at the prime above 3
# Using that f = g * t(g), equation (**) and the valuation of w,
# we find that the valuation of cg at the prime above 3 is -1,
# hence 3*cg is integral in K.

# This gives us the possibilities of the RHS of (**)
RHS = [K(9) * u * cg^5 for u in U]
# Note that we can change the unit by a fifth power of a unit in K
# without changing all the properties we wrote above of cg.
# We will do so to get more suitable hyperelliptic curves later on

# The equations are for case i
#   a^2 = RHSQ[i][0]

# Looking at these equations we can see that t1 must be divisible
# by 3 as a^2 and b^2 are integral, hence we can substitute 3*t1 for t1
RHSQ = [[poly(3*t1, t2) for poly in case] for case in RHSQ]
# We can exclude the case t2 = 0 as for that case a^2 and b^2 are not coprime

# Since t1 and t2 must be coprime, as a^2 and b^2 are
# these correspond to the points
#   (t1, t2) = (1, -6), (-1, 6) for the first case
#   (t1, t2) = (88, -23), (-88, 23) for the second case

print([(lcm([g.Order().sage() for g in J.AbelianGroup().Generators()])).factor() for J in Jm7]) # (2 * 5 * 11^2, 2 * 5 * 11^2)
# So all torsion points on the Jacobians must be two torsion points
# These we can compute explicitly, since both curves have an odd degree model
print([J.TwoTorsionSubgroup().Order() for J in JmOdd]) # [2, 2]
# So both Jacobians contain only two points
# One of each arises from the rational point on the corresponding hyperelliptic curve
# that does not correspond to a solution
# The other point corresponds to (the points on) the divisor
#   RHSQ[0][0](x, 1) = y = 0 for the first case
#   RHSQ[1][1](x, 1) = y = 0 for the second case
# Hence there exist no points on the hyperelliptic curves corresponding to solutions
# Hence there are no solutions!
