Q-curve with 3-isogeny for parameter -1

Decomposable curve of lowest conductor:

Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-180*sqrt_tu^3+459*sqrt_tu^2-144*sqrt_tu-684)*x + (246*sqrt_tu^3-5616*sqrt_tu^2+17472*sqrt_tu-19008) over Number Field in sqrt_tu with defining polynomial x^4 - 4*x^2 + 16

Newform levels:

(432,)

Newform of level 432:

q + 1/12*(a^3 + 30*a)*q^5 + 1/12*(a^3 + 18*a)*q^7 + 1/2*(-a^2 - 12)*q^11 + O(q^12)
