Q-curve with 3-isogeny for parameter -2

Decomposable curve of lowest conductor:

Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (54/5*sqrt_tu^3-12*sqrt_tu^2-138/5*sqrt_tu+132)*x + (-32/5*sqrt_tu^3+120*sqrt_tu^2-1776/5*sqrt_tu+440) over Number Field in sqrt_tu with defining polynomial x^4 - 2*x^2 + 25

Newform levels:

(20736, 20736)

Newform of level 20736:

q + a*q^5 + 2*a*q^7 + O(q^12)
