Q-curve with 3-isogeny for parameter -3

Decomposable curve of lowest conductor:

Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-891/4*sqrt_tu0+2187/2)*x + (3402*sqrt_tu0+15066) over Number Field in sqrt_tu0 with defining polynomial x^2 + 12

Newform levels:

(243,)

Newform of level 243:

q + a*q^2 + q^4 + 2*a*q^5 - q^7 - a*q^8 + 6*q^10 - 2*a*q^11 + O(q^12)
