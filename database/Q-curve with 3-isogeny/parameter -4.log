Q-curve with 3-isogeny for parameter -4

Decomposable curve of lowest conductor:

Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-279/7*sqrt_tu^3-387/2*sqrt_tu^2-3267/7*sqrt_tu-783/2)*x + (1434*sqrt_tu^3+3276*sqrt_tu^2+4170*sqrt_tu-11844) over Number Field in sqrt_tu with defining polynomial x^4 + 2*x^2 + 49

Newform levels:

(2160,)

Newform of level 2160:

q + 1/126*(-a^3 - 12*a^2 - 63*a - 124)*q^5 + 1/42*(a^3 + 12*a^2 + 21*a - 44)*q^11 + O(q^12)
