Q-curve with 3-isogeny for parameter -9

Decomposable curve of lowest conductor:

Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-1599/2*sqrt_tu^3+1008*sqrt_tu^2+3492*sqrt_tu+45333)*x + (-198603/2*sqrt_tu^3-393141*sqrt_tu^2-1361880*sqrt_tu-589806) over Number Field in sqrt_tu with defining polynomial x^4 + 12*x^2 + 144

Newform levels:

(19440,)

Newform of level 19440:

q + 1/24*a^2*q^5 + 1/48*(a^3 + 24*a)*q^7 + 1/48*(a^3 - 24*a)*q^11 + O(q^12)
