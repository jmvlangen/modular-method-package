Q-curve with 3-isogeny for parameter 6

Decomposable curve of lowest conductor:

Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (66*sqrt_tu^3-36*sqrt_tu^2-846*sqrt_tu-756)*x + (384*sqrt_tu^3+2040*sqrt_tu^2-13104*sqrt_tu-9288) over Number Field in sqrt_tu with defining polynomial x^4 - 18*x^2 + 9

Newform levels:

(311040, 311040)
