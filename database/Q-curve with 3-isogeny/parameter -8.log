Q-curve with 3-isogeny for parameter -8

Decomposable curve of lowest conductor:

Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-96/11*sqrt_tu^3+12*sqrt_tu^2+624/11*sqrt_tu+540)*x + (-1532/11*sqrt_tu^3-516*sqrt_tu^2-17388/11*sqrt_tu-340) over Number Field in sqrt_tu with defining polynomial x^4 + 10*x^2 + 121

Newform levels:

(6912, 6912)

Newform of level 6912:

q + a*q^5 - 1/2*a*q^7 - 6*q^11 + O(q^12)
