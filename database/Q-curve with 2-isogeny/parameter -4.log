Q-curve with 2-isogeny for parameter -4

Decomposable curve of lowest conductor:

Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-9*sqrt_tu0+36)*x^2 + (-81*sqrt_tu0-648)*x over Number Field in sqrt_tu0 with defining polynomial x^2 + 16

Newform levels:

(1280,)

Newform of level 1280:

q + a*q^3 - q^5 - 3*a*q^7 - q^9 + 4*a*q^11 + O(q^12)
