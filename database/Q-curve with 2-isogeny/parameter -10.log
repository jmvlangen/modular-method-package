Q-curve with 2-isogeny for parameter -10

Decomposable curve of lowest conductor:

Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (1566/62155*sqrt_tzeta0^7+144/2005*sqrt_tzeta0^6+19638/62155*sqrt_tzeta0^5+1224/401*sqrt_tzeta0^4+47034/12431*sqrt_tzeta0^3+16272/401*sqrt_tzeta0^2-4320/12431*sqrt_tzeta0+126540/401)*x^2 + (-1620/12431*sqrt_tzeta0^7+7614/2005*sqrt_tzeta0^6-101331/12431*sqrt_tzeta0^5+32238/401*sqrt_tzeta0^4-1597401/12431*sqrt_tzeta0^3+535572/401*sqrt_tzeta0^2-27580905/12431*sqrt_tzeta0+3361500/401)*x over Number Field in sqrt_tzeta0 with defining polynomial x^8 + 30*x^6 + 535*x^4 + 4850*x^2 + 24025
