Q-curve with 2-isogeny for parameter -2

Decomposable curve of lowest conductor:

Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 36*x^2 + (162*sqrt_t+162)*x over Number Field in sqrt_t with defining polynomial x^2 + 2

Newform levels:

(1536,)

Newform of level 1536:

q + q^3 + a*q^5 + a*q^7 + q^9 + 2*q^11 + O(q^12)
