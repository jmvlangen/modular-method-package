Q-curve with 2-isogeny for parameter -9

Decomposable curve of lowest conductor:

Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-6*sqrt_tu0+36)*x^2 + (-54*sqrt_tu0-972)*x over Number Field in sqrt_tu0 with defining polynomial x^2 + 36

Newform levels:

(2560,)

Newform of level 2560:

q + a*q^3 + q^5 + 1/2*a*q^7 + 5*q^9 - 1/2*a*q^11 + O(q^12)
