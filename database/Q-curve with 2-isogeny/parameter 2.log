Q-curve with 2-isogeny for parameter 2

Decomposable curve of lowest conductor:

Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-18*sqrt_tu0-36)*x^2 + (-81*sqrt_tu0-162)*x over Number Field in sqrt_tu0 with defining polynomial x^2 - 8

Newform levels:

(512,)

Newform of level 512:

q + a*q^3 + 2*a*q^5 + 4*q^7 - q^9 + a*q^11 + O(q^12)
