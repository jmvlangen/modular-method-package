Q-curve with 2-isogeny for parameter 5

Decomposable curve of lowest conductor:

Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (-27/82*sqrt_tuzeta00^3-270/41*sqrt_tuzeta00^2+2790/41*sqrt_tuzeta00+5220/41)*x^2 + (405/41*sqrt_tuzeta00^3-25110/41*sqrt_tuzeta00^2+137700/41*sqrt_tuzeta00+396900/41)*x over Number Field in sqrt_tuzeta00 with defining polynomial x^4 - 60*x^2 - 80*x + 80

Newform levels:

(800, 800)

Newform of level 800:

q + (-a + 1)*q^3 + (a + 1)*q^7 + a*q^9 - 4*a*q^11 + O(q^12)
