Q-curve with 2-isogeny for parameter 8

Decomposable curve of lowest conductor:

Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (9*sqrt_tu0-36)*x^2 + (-324*sqrt_tu0+1782)*x over Number Field in sqrt_tu0 with defining polynomial x^2 - 32

Newform levels:

(1792,)

Newform of level 1792:

q + a*q^3 + a*q^5 - q^7 - q^9 - 2*a*q^11 + O(q^12)
