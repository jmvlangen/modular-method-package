Q-curve with 2-isogeny for parameter 3

Decomposable curve of lowest conductor:

Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (6*sqrt_tu0-12)*x^2 + (-54*sqrt_tu0+180)*x over Number Field in sqrt_tu0 with defining polynomial x^2 - 12

Newform levels:

(1536,)

Newform of level 1536:

q + (-a + 1)*q^3 + a*q^5 + 3*a*q^7 + (-2*a - 1)*q^9 + 4*q^11 + O(q^12)
