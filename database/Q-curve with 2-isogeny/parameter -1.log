Q-curve with 2-isogeny for parameter -1

Decomposable curve of lowest conductor:

Q-curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + (18*sqrt_tu0+36)*x^2 + (162*sqrt_tu0+324)*x over Number Field in sqrt_tu0 with defining polynomial x^2 + 4

Newform levels:

(512,)

Newform of level 512:

q + a*q^3 - 2*q^5 - 2*a*q^7 - q^9 - 3*a*q^11 + O(q^12)
