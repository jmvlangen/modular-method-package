    r"""
    Eliminates newforms associated to frey curves by the trace
    of frobenius at a given prime..

    Given one or multiple frey curves with the same
    parameters, compares the trace of frobenius at a
    given prime to that of the respective newforms
    in a list of newforms, eliminating all those newforms
    for which the traces do not agree modulo l.

    INPUT:

    - ``curves`` -- A frey curve or a list/tuple of frey
      curves that share the same parameters.
    - ``newforms`` -- A list of newforms that are
      associated to the given frey curve, i.e. such that
      their mod-l representations could be isomorphic
      to the mod-l representation of the frey curve.
      Instead of a list one can also give the value
      None, in which case the list will be retrieved
      from the curve by the method
      :meth:`newform_candidates` of the given Frey curve.
      If multiple Frey curves are given this argument
      should be a tuple of length equal to the number
      of given Frey curves, containing for each Frey
      curve an entry as described above in the same order
      as the Frey curves are given.
      Alternatively the input may also be a list of
      tuples wherein each tuple has length equal to
      the number of Frey curves and each entry thereof
      is a newform associated to the corresponding Frey
      curve.
      In the last input format, each tuple may also be
      1 longer than the number of Frey curves, in which
      case the last entry must be an integer divisible
      by all primes l for which the mod-l representations
      of the given elliptic curves may still be
      isomorphic to the corresponding newforms in this
      tuple. This can be used to chain multiple
      elimination methods.
      Everywhere where a list is expected, one may also
      give a ConditionalValue of which the possible
      values are lists of the expected format. The
      method will be applied to each entry individually
      and the condition will be replaced by the condition
      that both the given condition and the condition
      at which that value is attained hold.
    - ``prime`` -- A prime number that lies below the primes
      over which the traces of frobenius should be taken.
      Note that for the newforms this will indeed be the
      prime corresponding to the frobenius map considered,
      whilst for the elliptic curves a prime above this
      prime number will be chosen if the curve is defined
      over a number field rather than QQ.
    - ``B`` -- A non-negative integer (default: 0).
      Whenever the traces of frobenius disagree for the
      mod-l representations, the prime factor l will only
      be removed from the corresponding last entry of the
      tuple of newforms if the prime also divides this
      number B.
    - ``condition`` -- A Condition giving the
      restrictions on the parameters of the given
      Frey curve that should be considered. By default
      this will be set to the condition stored in
      the first given Frey curve.
    - ``precision_cap`` -- A non-negative integer
      (default: 1) giving the maximal precision used
      to compute the reduction type of a Frey curve
      at a prime. Note that setting this value to
      a value higher than 1 might result in a long
      computation time and heavy memory usage and
      is strongly discouraged.
    - ``verbose`` -- A boolean value or an integer
      (default: False). When set to True or any value
      larger then zero will print comments to stdout
      about the computations being done whilst busy. If
      set to False or 0 will not print such comments.
      If set to any negative value will also prevent
      the printing of any warnings.
      If this method calls any method that accepts an
      argument verbose will pass this argument to it.
      If such a method fulfills a minor task within
      this method and the argument verbose was larger
      than 0, will instead pass 1 less than the given
      argument. This makes it so a higher value will
      print more details about the computation than a
      lower one.

    OUTPUT:
    
    A list of tuples, wherein each tuple contains:
    - for each frey curve given a corresponding newform
      for which an isomorphism between the mod-l
      representations of that curve and that newform
      could not be excluded by this method.
    - as its last entry an integer that is divisible
      by all prime numbers l for which the mentioned
      mod-l galois representations could still exist.
      Note that this number is always 0 if there is
      infinitely many such l remaining.

      of the given elliptic curves may still be
      isomorphic to the corresponding newforms in this
      tuple. This can be used to chain multiple
      elimination methods.
      Everywhere where a list is expected, one may also
      give a ConditionalValue of which the possible
      values are lists of the expected format. The
      method will be applied to each entry individually
      and the condition will be replaced by the condition
      that both the given condition and the condition
      at which that value is attained hold.
    - ``prime`` -- A prime number.
    - ``polynomials`` -- A polynomial or list thereof
      in the common parameters of the given Frey curves,
      such that these polynomials are l-th powers.
    - ``primes`` -- A list of prime numbers or a
      strictly positive integer (default: 200). This
      list should contain all prime numbers for which
      the traces of frobenius at that prime should be
      compared. If it is set to a strictly positive
      integer will initialize this as the list
      prime_range(l, primes). Note that only those
      primes for which the relevant residue fields
      have order congruent to 1 mod l will be
      actually considered.
    - ``condition`` -- A Condition giving the
      restrictions on the parameters of the given
      Frey curve that should be considered. By default
      this will be set to the condition stored in
      the first given Frey curve.
    - ``precision_cap`` -- A non-negative integer
      (default: 1) giving the maximal precision used
      to compute the reduction type of a Frey curve
      at a prime. Note that setting this value to
      a value higher than 1 might result in a long
      computation time and heavy memory usage and
      is strongly discouraged.
    - ``verbose`` -- A boolean value or an integer
      (default: False). When set to True or any value
      larger then zero will print comments to stdout
      about the computations being done whilst busy. If
      set to False or 0 will not print such comments.
      If set to any negative value will also prevent
      the printing of any warnings.
      If this method calls any method that accepts an
      argument verbose will pass this argument to it.
      If such a method fulfills a minor task within
      this method and the argument verbose was larger
      than 0, will instead pass 1 less than the given
      argument. This makes it so a higher value will
      print more details about the computation than a
      lower one.
