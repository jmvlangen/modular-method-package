r"""Classes to work with diophantine equations containing a prime
power.

Given a diophantine equation of the form .. MATH::

    f(x_1, \ldots, x_n) = y^l

with $f$ some polynomial, one can show some results about integer
solutions $x_1, \ldots, x_n, y, l$ with $l$ prime. This file adds a
class that automates some of the reasoning done for this.
