    Computes the newforms of a given level and character.

      the level of the newforms.

      conductor divides the given level.

      arguments:
       - 'sage' - (default) If sage should be used to
         compute the newforms.
       - 'magma' - If magma should be used to compute
         the newforms.
    - ``minimal_coeffs`` -- A number field or the rationals
      (default: QQ) that should be contained inf the
      coefficient field of each newform computed.
    - ``names`` -- An argument required by the sage
      implementation of newforms to be used as the names
      for the generator of coefficient fields of newforms
      that are not QQ.

    exactly one newform in each galois orbit of newforms
    that are invariant under \gamma_1(level) with as
    character the given character. Furthermore the
    coefficient field of each of these newforms extends
    the given field minimal_coeffs.

    Note that these are instances of Newform_wrapped to
    provide a uniform way of computing with the newforms
    after they are created that is independant of the
    algorithm used to compute them.
