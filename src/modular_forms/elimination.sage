r"""Functions to eliminate newforms corresponding to Frey curves

Given a diophantine problem for which we can associate to a solution a
Frey–Hellegouarch curve, we can prove the non-existence of that
solution by showing that the mod $l$ galois representation of that
curve is the same as the mod $l$ galois representation of a newform in
some finite list and procedurally eliminate these newforms. This file
provides implementations of the often used methods to eliminate these
newforms.

For the most part elimination is done by comparing the traces of a
newform with the possible traces of the corresponding
Frey–Hellegouarch curve. The method :func:`eliminate_by_trace` does
this for the frobenius map above a single prime, whilst the method
:func:`eliminate_by_traces` does the same for multiple primes at a
time. Note that both function can also work with multiple Frey curves
at a time to improve elimination.

Besides standard comparison of traces, we can also use the method of
Kraus implemented in :meth:`kraus_method` to eliminate newforms for a
specific prime $l$.

Another method of eliminating newforms is provided by the function
:func:`eliminate_cm_forms` which eliminates all the newforms with
complex multiplication if the corresponding Frey curve does not have
complex multiplication.

Lastly there is a method $eliminate_primes$ which allows one to
eliminate newforms for which we can determine that a certain mod $l$
galois representation correspondence can not exist by some other
means.

Every elimination method in this file will return a uniform output
that can again be used again as a input for another elimination
method. This output is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a
newform corresponding to each Frey curve on which the method was
applied and as a last entry an integer divisible by all primes $l$ for
which the mod $l$ of each newform in the tuple might still correspond
to the mod $l$ representation of the corresponding Frey curve.

The function :func:`combine_newforms` allows one to combine the
different outputs of elimination methods into a single output. This is
usefull if one wants to perform elimination methods first on several
Frey curves individually and then use the results to perform some
elimination methods in which you use all curves simultaneously.

def eliminate_by_trace(curves, newforms, prime, B=0, condition=None,

    r"""Eliminate newforms associated to Frey curves by the trace of
    frobenius at a given prime.

    Let $E$ be a Frey curve, $f$ be a newform of which the mod $l$
    galois representations might agree with the mod $l$ galois
    representation of $E$, and $F$ be a frobenius element of the
    common domain of the afore mentioned representations. By comparing
    the traces of these representations at $F$ we can check if the
    representations are indeed the same. If not we eliminate the
    newform for mod $l$ representations. This method will perform this
    elimination for a single Frobenius element.

    Note that the value of the trace of Frobenius for the Frey curve
    might depend on the value of the variables. In this case we
    eliminate the newform if the trace of Frobenius for the newform
    can not correspond to any of the possible traces for the elliptic
    curve. If we have multiple Frey curves we compare traces
    simultaneously for each combination of associated newforms, in
    which case we eliminate a tuple of newforms if there is no
    associated possible tuple of traces.

    INPUT:

    - ``curves`` -- A Frey curve or a list/tuple of Frey curves that
      share the same parameters.

    - ``newforms`` -- A list of newforms that are associated to the
      given Frey curve, i.e. such that their mod-l representations
      could be isomorphic to the mod-l representation of the Frey
      curve.  Instead of a list one can also give the value None, in
      which case the list will be retrieved from the curve by the
      method :meth:`newform_candidates` of the given Frey curve.

      If multiple Frey curves are given this argument should be a
      tuple of length equal to the number of given Frey curves,
      containing for each Frey curve an entry as described above in
      the same order as the Frey curves are given.

      Alternatively the input may also be a list of tuples wherein
      each tuple has length equal to the number of Frey curves and
      each entry thereof is a newform associated to the corresponding
      Frey curve.

      In the last input format, each tuple may also be 1 longer than
      the number of Frey curves, in which case the last entry must be
      an integer divisible by all primes l for which the mod-l
      representations of the given elliptic curves may still be
      isomorphic to the corresponding newforms in this tuple. This can
      be used to chain multiple elimination methods.

      Everywhere where a list is expected, one may also give a
      ConditionalValue of which the possible values are lists of the
      expected format. The method will be applied to each entry
      individually and the condition will be replaced by the condition
      that both the given condition and the condition at which that
      value is attained hold.

    - ``prime`` -- A finite prime of the field in which the parameters
      of the Frey curves live. This will be the prime underlying the
      Frobenius element for which the traces of the galois
      representations at that element should be compared. It should be
      given as a prime number if the field of the parameters is the
      rationals and a prime ideal otherwise. Note that the Frobenius
      elements might be chosen for primes lying above these primes if
      the base fields of the Galois representations considered are
      larger than the field of the parameters.

    - ``B`` -- A non-negative integer (default: 0). Will only
      eliminate newforms based on their mod $l$ representation if $l$
      divides this number.

    - ``condition`` -- A Condition giving the restrictions on the
      parameters of the given Frey curve(s) that should be
      considered. By default this will be set to the condition stored
      in the first given Frey curve.

    - ``precision_cap`` -- A non-negative integer (default: 1) giving
      the maximal precision used to compute the reduction type of a
      Frey curve at a prime. Note that setting this value to a value
      higher than 1 might result in a long computation time and heavy
      memory usage and is strongly discouraged.

    - ``verbose`` -- A boolean value or an integer (default:
      False). When set to True or any value larger then zero will
      print comments to stdout about the computations being done
      whilst busy. If set to False or 0 will not print such comments.
      If set to any negative value will also prevent the printing of
      any warnings.  A higher value will cause more messages to be
      printed.

    OUTPUT:
    
    A list of tuples, wherein each tuple contains:

    - for each frey curve given a corresponding newform for which an
      isomorphism between the mod $l$ galois representations of that
      curve and that newform could not be excluded by this method.

    - as its last entry an integer that is divisible by all prime
      numbers $l$ for which the mentioned mod $l$ galois
      representations could still exist. Note that this number is
      always 0 if there is infinitely many such $l$ remaining.

    r"""Eliminate newforms associated to Frey curves by the traces of
    Frobenius.

    Let $E$ be a Frey curve, $f$ be a newform of which the mod $l$
    galois representations might agree with the mod $l$ galois
    representation of $E$ and $F$ be a frobenius element of the common
    domain of the afore mentioned representations. By comparing the
    traces of these representations at $F$ we can check if the
    representations are indeed the same. If not we eliminate the
    newform for mod $l$ representations. This function will perform
    this elimination for multiple Frobenius elements.

    Note that the value of the trace of Frobenius for the Frey curve
    might depend on the value of the variables. In this case we
    eliminate the newform if the trace of Frobenius for the newform
    can not correspond to any of the possible traces for the elliptic
    curve. If we have multiple Frey curves we compare traces
    simultaneously for each combination of associated newforms, in
    which case we eliminate a tuple of newforms if there is no
    associated possible tuple of traces.

    INPUT:

    - ``curves`` -- A Frey curve or a list/tuple of Frey curves that
      share the same parameters.

    - ``newforms`` -- A list of newforms that are associated to the
      given frey curve, i.e. such that their mod-l representations
      could be isomorphic to the mod-l representation of the frey
      curve.  Instead of a list one can also give the value None, in
      which case the list will be retrieved from the curve by the
      method :meth:`newform_candidates` of the given Frey curve.

      If multiple Frey curves are given this argument should be a
      tuple of length equal to the number of given Frey curves,
      containing for each Frey curve an entry as described above in
      the same order as the Frey curves are given.

      Alternatively the input may also be a list of tuples wherein
      each tuple has length equal to the number of Frey curves and
      each entry thereof is a newform associated to the corresponding
      Frey curve.

      In the last input format, each tuple may also be 1 longer than
      the number of Frey curves, in which case the last entry must be
      an integer divisible by all primes l for which the mod-l
      representations of the given elliptic curves may still be
      isomorphic to the corresponding newforms in this tuple. This can
      be used to chain multiple elimination methods.

      Everywhere where a list is expected, one may also give a
      ConditionalValue of which the possible values are lists of the
      expected format. The method will be applied to each entry
      individually and the condition will be replaced by the condition
      that both the given condition and the condition at which that
      value is attained hold.

    - ``condition`` -- A Condition giving the restrictions on the
      parameters of the given Frey curve(s) that should be
      considered. By default this will be set to the condition stored
      in the first given Frey curve.

    - ``primes`` -- A list of finite primes of the field in which the
      parameters of the Frey curves live or a strictly positive
      integer (default: 50). The latter corresponds to all the finite
      primes of that field above a prime number smaller than the given
      integer. These will be the primes underlying the Frobenius
      elements for which the traces of the galois representations at
      that element should be compared. Each prime should be give as a
      prime number if the field of the parameters is the rationals and
      a prime ideal otherwise. Note that the Frobenius elements might
      be chosen for primes lying above these primes if the base fields
      of the Galois representations considered are larger than the
      field of the parameters.

    - ``precision_cap`` -- A non-negative integer (default: 1) giving
      the maximal precision used to compute the reduction type of a
      Frey curve at a prime. Note that setting this value to a value
      higher than 1 might result in a long computation time and heavy
      memory usage and is strongly discouraged.

    - ``verbose`` -- A boolean value or an integer (default:
      False). When set to True or any value larger then zero will
      print comments to stdout about the computations being done
      whilst busy. If set to False or 0 will not print such comments.
      If set to any negative value will also prevent the printing of
      any warnings.  A higher value will cause more messages to be
      printed.

    OUTPUT:
    
    A list of tuples, wherein each tuple contains:

    - for each frey curve given a corresponding newform for which an
      isomorphism between the mod $l$ galois representations of that
      curve and that newform could not be excluded by this method.

    - as its last entry an integer that is divisible by all prime
      numbers $l$ for which the mentioned mod $l$ galois

def eliminate_primes(curves, newforms, N, condition=None):
    r"""Eliminate newforms associated to Frey curves for certain primes.

    For multiple prime numbers $l$ this function eliminates all those
    newforms for which the mod $l$ galois representation might agree
    with the mod $l$ galois representation of the associated Frey
    curve.

    INPUT:

    - ``curves`` -- A Frey curve or a list/tuple of Frey curves that
      share the same parameters.

    - ``newforms`` -- A list of newforms that are associated to the
      given frey curve, i.e. such that their mod-l representations
      could be isomorphic to the mod-l representation of the frey
      curve.  Instead of a list one can also give the value None, in
      which case the list will be retrieved from the curve by the
      method :meth:`newform_candidates` of the given Frey curve.

      If multiple Frey curves are given this argument should be a
      tuple of length equal to the number of given Frey curves,
      containing for each Frey curve an entry as described above in
      the same order as the Frey curves are given.

      Alternatively the input may also be a list of tuples wherein
      each tuple has length equal to the number of Frey curves and
      each entry thereof is a newform associated to the corresponding
      Frey curve.

      In the last input format, each tuple may also be 1 longer than
      the number of Frey curves, in which case the last entry must be
      an integer divisible by all primes l for which the mod-l
      representations of the given elliptic curves may still be
      isomorphic to the corresponding newforms in this tuple. This can
      be used to chain multiple elimination methods.

      Everywhere where a list is expected, one may also give a
      ConditionalValue of which the possible values are lists of the
      expected format. The method will be applied to each entry
      individually and the condition will be replaced by the condition
      that both the given condition and the condition at which that
      value is attained hold.

    - ``N`` -- A non-zero integer, divisible by all those primes $l$
      for which the newforms that could still be related by mod $l$
      galois representations should be eliminated.

    - ``condition`` -- A Condition giving the restrictions on the
      parameters of the given Frey curve(s) that should be
      considered. By default this will be set to the condition stored
      in the first given Frey curve. Note that this is only relevant
      if the newforms are not given yet.

    OUTPUT:
    
    A list of tuples, wherein each tuple contains:

    - for each frey curve given a corresponding newform for which an
      isomorphism between the mod $l$ galois representations of that
      curve and that newform could not be excluded by this method.

    - as its last entry an integer that is divisible by all prime
      numbers $l$ for which the mentioned mod $l$ galois
      representations could still be isomorphic. Note that this number
      is always 0 if there is infinitely many such $l$ remaining.
