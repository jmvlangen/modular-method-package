r"""Classes to work with Frey-Hellegouarch curves.

A Frey-Hellegouarch curve, often referred to simply as a Frey curve,
is an elliptic curve of which the coefficients depend on an (unknown)
solution of a diophantine equation. For our purposes a Frey curve will
be an elliptic curve defined over a ring $R$, that is a (multivariate)
polynomial ring over some number field $L$. The variables of $R$ are
assumed to take on undetermined values in the ring of integers of some
subfield $K$ of $L$, which might satisfy some constraints. These
variables are known as the parameters of the Frey curve.

This file provides two variants of Frey curves. The class
:class:`FreyCurve` provides the basic implementation of a Frey
curve. However computing newforms for such a Frey curve only works if
its defined over the rationals. The class :class:`FreyQcurve` extends
the class :class:`FreyCurve` and the class :class:`Qcurve` and
provides a way to work with Frey curves that are also $\Q$-curves.

EXAMPLES:

The classical example, Fermat's Last Theorem that $x^n + y^n = z^n$
has no non-trivial solutions for $n > 3$. In this example we use a
Frey curve based on a solution $(a, b, c)$ with $a b c \ne 0$ for $n$
a prime number $l > 2$. Without loss of generality we assume that $b
\equiv 1$ modulo 4. In this example we use `al`, `bl`, and `cl` for
$a^l$, $b^l$, and $c^l$ respectively::

A more involved example for the equation $x^n + y^n = 2 z^n$ from the
article "Winding quotients and some variants of Fermat's Last Theorem"
by Henri Darmon and LoÃ¯c Merel (1997). We let $(a, b, c)$ be a
solution of this equation for $n$ a prime number $p \ge 7$ with
$\gcd(a, b, c) = 1$ and $|a b c| > 1$. We denote by `ap`, `bp`, and
`cp` the values $a^p$, $b^p$ and $c^p$ respectively. As in the article
we assume that $a \equiv -1$ modulo 4::

We use the Frey curve for the equation $A^4 + B^2 = C^p$ from the
article "Galois representations attached to Q-curves and the
generalized Fermat equation $A^4 + B^2 = C^p$" by Jordan S. Ellenberg
(2004) as an example of a Frey Q-curve. We will let $(A, B, C)$ be a
solution to this equation for $p \ge 211$ prime with $ A B \ne 0 $ and
$B \not\equiv 1$ modulo 4. We will use `Cp` to denote $C^p$::

    r"""A Frey-Hellegouarch curve.

    A Frey-Hellegouarch curve, or simply a Frey curve, is an elliptic
    curve defined over a (multivariate) polynomial ring $R$ defined
    over some number field $L$. The variables of $R$ are assumed to
    have undetermined values in the ring of integers of some subfield
    $K$ of $L$ and are considered to be parameters of $E$. Therefore
    this elliptic curve is considered as an elliptic curve over $L$.

    This class provides some functionality to compute with this
    elliptic curve as if it is defined over the number field
    $L$. Since the answer of some of these computations might depend
    on the values of the parameters, the result is often given as
    :class:`ConditionalValue`. Most methods also given te option of
    providing additional constraints on the parameters in the form of
    instances of :class:`Condition` and this curve can also internally
    stores a condition on the parameters which is used as a default
    restraint.

    EXAMPLES:

    The classical example, Fermat's Last Theorem that $x^n + y^n = z^n$
    has no non-trivial solutions for $n > 3$. In this example we use a
    Frey curve based on a solution $(a, b, c)$ with $a b c \ne 0$ for $n$
    a prime number $l > 2$. Without loss of generality we assume that $b
    \equiv 1$ modulo 4. In this example we use `al`, `bl`, and `cl` for
    $a^l$, $b^l$, and $c^l$ respectively::

          produce such a curve when passed to the constructor

          over some (multivariate) polynomial ring $R$ which in turn
          is defined over some number field $L$. This will be the Frey
          curve.

        - ``parameter_ring`` -- The ring of integers of a subfield $K$
          of $L$ (default: ZZ). This is the ring in which the
          variables of the polynomial ring over which this curve is
          defined can take values.

        - ``condition`` -- An instance of :class:`Condition` or None
          (default: None) giving a condition which must hold for the

          parameters on this Frey curve that should be considered. By
          default this will be set to the condition associated to this
          FreyCurve.

        - ``bad_primes`` -- An iterable containing prime ideals or
          prime numbers, if the field of definition is QQ, that
          contains all the primes at which this curve can have
          additive reduction. If set to None will compute this by
          using the method primes_of_possible_additive_reduction

        - ``algorithm`` -- One of the following values 'sage' -- to
          use sage to compute newforms (default) 'magma' -- to use
          magma to compute newforms

        - ``primes`` -- A list of prime numbers or a strictly positive
          integer (default: 50). This list gives all the primes at
          which the traces of frobenius of the different galois
          representations should be compared. If set to strictly
          positive integer, will be initialized as the list of all
          prime numbers less than the given number.

        - ``verbose`` -- A boolean value or an integer (default:
          False). When set to True or any value larger then zero will
          print comments to stdout about the computations being done
          whilst busy. If set to False or 0 will not print such
          comments.  If set to any negative value will also prevent
          the printing of any warnings.  If this method calls any
          method that accepts an argument verbose will pass this
          argument to it.  If such a method fulfills a minor task
          within this method and the argument verbose was larger than
          0, will instead pass 1 less than the given argument. This
          makes it so a higher value will print more details about the
          computation than a lower one.

        - ``precision_cap_conductor`` -- A strictly positive integer
          (default: 20) giving the maximal precision level to be used
          in p-Adic arithmetic when computing the conductor.

        - ``precision_cap_reduction`` -- A strictly positive integer
          (default: 1) giving the maximal precision level to be used
          in the p-Adic arithmetic when computing the reduction type
          at a given prime. Since this will do a computation for every
          prime lower than prime_cap, this might get very
          computational intensive if set to a value larger than 1.

        - ``path`` -- A string or None (default: None). A parameter
          only used if the algorithm is set to file, in which case
          this should be a path to the file from which to load
          newforms.

        A list consisting of pairs with as first entry a newform that
        has a mod-l representation that has traces of frobenius that
        could match the traces of frobenius of this curve for all
        given primes, different from l. The second entry is an integer
        divisible by all prime numbers l for which this can be true.
        
        If the level of the newform might depend on a choice of
        parameters will instead give a conditional value wherein each
        value is of the form above and each condition corresponds to a

        r"""Compute the levels of newforms that could be associated to this
        Frey Q-curve.

        Each non-CM Q-curve is the quotient of a $\Q$-simple variety
        of GL_2-type, which in turn is isogenous to an abelian
        varietyr associated to a newform. The $\lambda$-adic galois
        representation of this newform is isomorphic to the $l$-adic
        galois representation of the Q-curve when restricted to a
        common subgroup of the absolute galois group of $\QQ$. Here
        $\lambda$ is a prime dividing $l$ in the coefficient field of
        the newform.

        The conductor of an abelian variety associated to a newform is
        $N^n$, where $N$ is the level of the newform and $n$ is the
        dimension of the variety. If the Q-curve decomposes, the
        factors of its restriction of scalars form abelian varieties
        of associated newforms. These newforms are directly related to
        the splitting maps of the Q-curves, in the sense that they are
        twists of one another by the inverse of the twist characters
        and their characters are the inverse of the splitting
        characters. Using results about the change in level when
        twisting a newform and the conductor of the restriction of
        scalars, a guess for the levels of the newforms can be made.

        Let $E$ be an elliptic and $P$ be a prime of its decomposition
        field for which the order of $P$ in the discriminant of $E$ is
        divisible by a prime number $l$ and for which $E$ does not
        have additive reduction. In that case is the mod $l$ galois
        representation of $E$ unramified at $P$. In case $E$ is a
        $\Q$-curve and $P$ is not ramified in the decomposition field,
        this implies that the corresponding mod $\lambda$
        representation of an associated newform is unramified at the
        prime number $p$ below $P$. In this case we would be able to
        find a newform of a lower level that has an isomorphic mod
        $\lambda$ representation. To be precise the lower level is the
        part of the level that is coprime to $p$.

        In the case we have a Frey Q-curve $E$ and only a finite set
        $S$ of bad primes of its decompisition field, i.e. primes $P$
        for which the curve $E$ has additive reduction, that ramify in
        the decomposition field or for which their order in the
        discriminat of $E$ is not divisible by $l$, we know by level
        lowering that the mod $l$ representation of $E$ is isomorphic
        to the mod $\lambda$ galois representation of newforms with a
        level only divisible by prime numbers below primes in the set
        $S$. This function computes the possible levels for a given
